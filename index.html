          <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>As virtual reality (VR) continues to gain prominence as a
            medium for artistic expression, a growing number of projects
            explore the use of VR for musical interaction design. In
            this paper, we discuss the concept of VIMEs (Virtual Interfaces
            for Musical Expression) through four case studies
            that explore different aspects of musical interactions in virtual
            environments. We then describe a user study designed
            to evaluate these VIMEs in terms of various usability considerations,
            such as immersion, perception of control, learnability
            and physical effort. We offer the results of the study,
            articulating the relationship between the design of a VIME
            and the various performance behaviors observed among its
            users. Finally, we discuss how these results, combined with
            recent developments in VR technology, can inform the design
            of new VIMEs.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="introduction">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>VR is rapidly becoming a new frontier
            in NIME research, enabling artists and researchers to explore the
            novel affordances of immersive systems for the design of
            digital musical interfaces.
            In this paper, we discuss the concept of virtual interfaces
            for musical expression (VIMEs) in terms of the unique opportunities
            and challenges that they bring to musical interaction
            design. We describe the conceptual design, implementation and usability
            of four VIMEs. We then discuss a user study that investigates
            how the different design choices in these four VIMEs affect
            user behaviors in VR.</p>

            <h2>VIMEs</h2>
            <p>Digital musical instruments can sever the tie between a
            physical expression and its acoustic outcome. Although
            this may disrupt the action-perception feedback loops inherent
            to musical performance, the computational mapping
            between performance input and auditory output can lead
            to otherwise impossible associations between movement and
            sound. VIMEs extend this evolution by employing designs
            that further liberate a musical interface from physical constraints.
            Exploiting the audiovisual mechanics of an arbitrarily
            defined virtual environment, and utilizing room-scale
            embodied movement through motion tracking, VIMEs can
            be conceived as systems that extend beyond instruments,
            enabling musical interactions that traverse a line between real
            and imaginary spaces.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="implementation">
          <h2>Implementation</h2>
          <p>The VIMEs discussed in this paper are designed for roomscale
            virtual experiences using the Oculus Rift S and the
            HTC Vive platforms. The choice of hardware
            platform for each design was accordingly informed by the
            tracking capabilities and hardware controller layouts that each platform offers. All
            four VIMEs were designed using Unity 3D. Google's Resonance
            Audio API was used for the binaural spatialization
            of the sounds.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="casestudies">
            <h2>Case Studies</h2>
            <p>To better understand the affordances of VR for musical interaction
            design, we developed four VIMEs as case studies.
            While each of the VIMEs explored a different facet of interaction
            design for VR, they all shared the following design
            guidelines:</p>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>The interface should only be possible to implement in
                    VR, exploiting interactive, physical, acoustical, and
                    visual affordances of VR.</li>
                <li>The interface can be informed by existing musical traditions,
                    mental models and learned sensorimotor behavior
                    or deviate from these entirely in the form of a
                    novel interface.</li>
                <li>The scale of the interface can range from that of an
                    instrument to that of an arbitrarily sized environment
                    conceived as a musical system.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="ballpit">
            <h3>Ball Pit</h3>
            <p>The Ball Pit is designed for the HTC Vive as a musical
            interface at the scale of an environment. As seen in the topleft
            panel in Fig. 1, the user is situated in an enclosed space with tiled walls, where they can move around physically in room scale. Using the left-hand controller the user can
            spawn an arbitrary number of balls in three different sizes. Once thrown into the room, the balls move without being affected by gravity. The user can grab the balls in mid-air
            or strike it with a virtual baton mapped to the right-hand
            controller. They can also remove the most recent ball or
            destroy all balls at once. Each tile displays a different shade of green and is tuned
            to a unique pitch from the chromatic scale. When a wall
            tile is struck by a ball, it lights up in red and emits a sound
            pulsaret reminiscent of the bouncing of a ping-pong ball.
            While the pitch of the sound is based on the tuning of a
            tile, its octave is determined by the size of the ball (i.e.
            smaller balls produce higher-octave sounds).</p>

        <div id="laserharp">
            <h3>Laser Harp</h3>
            <p>Designed for the HTC Vive, the Laser Harp re-imagines the
            traditional string instrument as a room-scale interface that
            extends between the performer and the virtual environment.
            Eight strings extend between the user's left hand and a
            bridge affixed to the ceiling as seen in the top-right panel in
            Fig. 1. A virtual bow mapped to the right-hand controller
            allows the user to strum and bow the strings.
            The sounds are synthesized using the Karplus-Strong algorithm
            to achieve plucked and sustained string sounds with
            velocity-sensitivity. The touchpad on the left-hand controller
            can be used to scroll through four different musical
            scales, namely major, minor, chromatic and whole-tone
            scales. Moving the left hand, the user can stretch the strings
            to tune them. The rotation of the left hand controls the cutoff
            frequency of a low pass filter, allowing the user to alter
            the timbre of instrument.</p>

        <div id="marbells">
            <h3>Marbells</h3>
            <p>Marbells is designed for the Oculus Rift S in the scale of an
            environment wherein the user can design a musical causality
            system by placing resonant blocks in the pathway of marbles
            that fall off of four pipes placed in the corners of a virtual
            room as seen in the bottom left panel in Fig. 1. A belllike
            sound is heard when a marble comes in contact with
            a block. The marbles adhere to classical physics as they
            bounce off of the blocks and disappear once they reach the
            floor. The virtual environment extends beyond room scale
            to allow for elaborate causality systems; while the user can
            move physically within the confines of the play area, they
            can use the thumbsticks on the Touch Controller to navigate
            beyond the tracked space.
            The user can spawn an arbitrary number of blocks from
            a selection of four different types, each with different timbral
            characteristics. This is achieved by grabbing the blocks
            from the center of the room, which re-spawn as their taken
            out of their corresponding pedestal. The blocks are not affected
            by physics and suspend in mid air when released.
            The user can point to pipes to change the clock division
            of the rate at which they emit balls and point to blocks to
            change their tuning on a pentatonic scale, creating diverse
            polyphonic and polyrhythmic structures.</p>

        <div id="orbit">
            <h3>ORBit</h3>
            <p>Designed for the Oculus Rift S, the ORBit encapsulates
            the performer in a cylindrical structure, which serves as a
            gallery of virtual musical objects as seen in the bottomright
            block in Fig. 1. Among these objects are 4 orbs that
            generate sounds and 2 auras that function as audio effects.
            The user can grab these objects and move them anywhere
            within their reach. Neither gravity nor ballistic forces affect
            the objects, which remain suspended in air when released.
            Once removed from their compartments, an orb emits a
            droning synthesized sound unique to it. The orb's position
            on the vertical axis controls the pitch of the drone that
            is spatially affixed to it. The two aura objects, offering
            low-pass filtering and distortion effects, adhere to a similar
            interaction model. An aura's proximity to an orb controls
            the strength of its effect on the orb's sound.</p>

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>We carried out a user study to understand how the different design considerations that
            govern these four VIMEs affected the users' experience in
            terms of control, physical effort and immersion among other
            factors.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="participants">
            <h3>Participants</h3>
            <p>20 users between the ages of 20 and 35 participated in the
            study. 7 users reported having received college education
            in music. Among these were performers, music tutors, and
            music technology students. All remaining users reported
            having a basic level of experience with music through music
            lessons or participation in bands. 13 users reported prior
            experience with VR, with 7 of them identifying themselves
            as a VR content creator. 18 participants reported prior
            experience with gaming.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="procedure">
            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <p> Each participant performs with all four VIMEs in a randomized
              order. At the end of each performance, they are asked to fill out
              a survey and respond to interview questions abot the particular VIME.
              At the end of the session, they fill out an exit survey, where they
              rank the four VIMEs. This is followed by a final interview question
              regarding the criteria used by the participant to rank the
              different designs. Each study session lasts for approximately an hour.


            <p>The per-VIME surveys include the same set of Likertscale
            questions about the following criteria: intuitiveness of
            the interface, ease of learning how to use the VIME, the
            extent to which the user felt in control of the interface, and
            whether the user would be able to replicate their performance
            with this VIME. Additionally, the user is asked to
            estimate the time they spent playing with the VIME and
            whether the interface reminded them of any other object,
            concept or experience.

            <p>In the exit survey, the user is asked to force-rank the
            VIMEs based on the following scales: From the easiest
            to control to the hardest control, from the one that demanded
            the most physical effort to the least, from the most
            instrument-like to the most game-like, from the most traditional
            to the least traditional, and from the most expressive
            to the least expressive. We describe the expressiveness of a
            VIME as the extent to which the VIME allowed the user to
            realize an idea, musical or otherwise. In the final question
            of the exit survey, the user is asked to rank the four VIMEs
            from the one they liked the best to the one they liked the
            least. </p>
        </div>

        <div id="results">
            <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
            <p>The average performance duration for each VIME was as
            follows: Ball Pit: 7.1 minutes (SD: 2.14); Laser Harp: 6.64
            minutes (SD: 2.51), Marbells: 8.23 minutes (SD: 2.11); Orbit:
            6.59 minutes (SD: 2.72). The data from the per-VIME
            survey questions can be seen in Figs. 2(a, b, c, d, e) with
            (e) indicating the average difference between the estimated
            and actual performance times for a VIME. The results of
            the exit survey can be seen in Figs. 2(f, g, h, i, j, k).</p>

        <div id="performancebehaviors">
            <h3>Performance Behaviors</h3>
            <p>In Ball Pit, some users spawned a limited number of balls and tried to
            maintain control over their movement. Conversely, others
            adopted an approach where they spawned an abundance of
            balls and struck them randomly as the balls flew by.   
            A transition
            between these two behaviors was also observed: gradually
            increasing the number of the balls, some users shifted their
                involvement from that of an active performer to a passive observer.<br>

            With Laset Harp, Most users expressed
            wanting to perform preconceived musical ideas. Much like with real instruments, this approach
            requires a learning process that may not be possible to fulfil
            within the confines of a user study. In our analysis of the
            string collision times, we observed a tendency towards playing
            adjacent strings in rapid successions. We believe this is
            mainly due to the fact that, unlike real string instruments,
            Laser Harp allows the user to pass the bow through the
            strings. In a recent study that compares tactile and virtual
            interactions with VR instruments, a similar user preference
            towards cutting through the strings is reported [5].<br>

            In Marbells, we observed an
            initial rough construction behavior, where the users explored the
            response of the system and the governing rules of physics.
            This then transitioned into a more deliberate approach,
            where they fine-tuned the musical causality system. As the users
            introduced more blocks into the environment complexity
            of the musical output increased with emergent structures
            that elude predictability. While some users embraced such
            structures by allocating more time to rough design, others
            worked with less blocks, focusing on finer adjustments.<br>

            In ORBit, we observed
            two primary performance behaviors: forming chords and performing phrases.
            In the first, the users were focused on the harmonic relationship between multiple orbs placed
            at different elevation levels. In the second, the users held
            on to an orb and moved it vertically to perform melodic
            structures. This behavior was also observed with the effect
            auras, when users, for instance, used the distortion effect to
            emphasize different notes in a chord.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="mental">
            <h3>Mental Associations</h3>
            <p>When dealing with a system, we associate it with external
            referents to form mental models that inform our understanding
            of the said system [7]. Accordingly, we explored
            how mental associations affect a user's approach to different
            VIMEs. After each performances, we asked users if
            they associated a VIME with an object, concept or previous
            experience. 

            8 users likened their experience with Ball Pit to playing
            a pitched percussion instrument due to the sound design
            of the system and the bodily interactions it prompts. 5
            users associated these interactions with sports games, such
            as racquetball and squash. This is reflected in Fig. 2(i)
            with the Ball Pit ranked as the most game-like VIME.
    
            12 users associated the Laser Harp with string instruments
            such as the harp, violin and cello. Furthermore,
            Fig. 2(i) shows that the Laser Harp was ranked as the most
            instrument-like VIME. We believe this strong association
            to an existing instrument have prompted users to adopt a
            more traditional approach with attempts at playing musical
            phrases akin to those that would be played with a violin.
            Many users associated Marbells with kinetic sculptures,
            legos and Rube Goldberg Machines. The latter, which was
            a point of departure in our design, was used by 5 participants
            without our prompt.

            Finally, ORBit was most commonly associated with music
            production tools, digital audio workstations (DAWs) and
            MIDI. Furthermore, users made explicit references to concepts
            like chords, music theory and DJ tools when describing
            their experience with this VIME.</p>

        <div id="presence">
            <h3>Presence</h3>
            <p>In their analysis of how to measure presence and involvement
            in virtual experiences, Witmer and Singer identify
            various factors including the ability to control events, compelling
            behavior among virtual objects, a convincing sense
            of mapping across modalities, and losing track of time among
            others [15]. Although a relationship between perceived performance
            time and the illusion of presence would require
            further research, our results do show a relationship between
            VIME preference and the difference between estimated and
            actual performance times, as seen in Fig. 2(e) and (k), with
            the assumption that greater differences imply further loss
            of tracked time.

            Most users expressed that the behavior of virtual objects
            conformed to their expectations from the VIMEs. Even
            when a system defied the rules of physics, the users were
            able to adjust to it as long as the behavior was consistent.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="control">
            <h3>Control</h3>
            <p>Dobrian and Koppelman describe control as a precondition
            for expressive interfaces, but add that the mere presence of
            control does not guarantee expression [6]. Although it
            is unreasonable to expect first-time users to gain expertise
            with a VIME in the context of a user study, we asked users
            to rank the four VIMEs in terms of expressiveness based
            on their limited experience. We do observe a correlation between the
            rankings on ease of control and expressiveness as seen in
            Figs. 2(f) and (h), and the users' evaluation of the extent
            to which they felt in control of individual VIMEs shown in (a).<br>

            With VIMEs that were ranked as most instrument-like,
            the users evaluated their performances to be mainly replicable.
            Conversely, the most game-like VIMES, namely Ball
            Pit and Marbells, were ranked relatively low in replicability
            with notable disagreement among users. This disagreement
            can be explained by the aforementioned variations in the
            performance behaviors among users with regards to exerting
            control over these VIMEs versus influencing an ongoing
            emergent musical process.<br>

            All VIMEs were ranked relatively high in terms of learnability.
            Moreover, learnability and intuitiveness rankings
            show strong agreement with the exception of the Marbells,
            which was rated highly learnable yet moderately intuitive.
            With this VIME, we observed most users to focus on the
            placement of the blocks in the scene, while making little use
            of the tempo and pitch change functionality. On the other hand,  it was ranked relatively high in expressiveness;
            which might
            have given the users a sense that they learned how to use it
            even though they did not exploit some of its functionality.<br>
                
            While the physical effort rankings seen in Fig. 2(g) did not
            show significant agreement across users, these give some interesting
            insights with regards to how physical effort might
            be perceived in VR. ORBit required users to stand in one
            spot and move virtual objects on the vertical axis. Relying
            on virtual navigation, Marbells demanded a similar
            type of physical activity while placing blocks in 3D space.
            On the other hand, Ball Pit was a room-scale experience
            that the users often associated with playing a sports game.
            A possible explanation of this counter-intuitive outcome is
            the user's interpretation of the dexterity involved in placing
            the virtual objects in Marbells and ORBit to be more
            taxing than the free form physical activity performed with
            Ball Pit. </p>

        <div id="conclusions">
            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>VR offers distinct possibilities for musical interaction design,
            particularly with regards to the liberation of the interface
            from physical constraints and the ability to map user
            input to audible outcome using arbitrarily defined mechanics
            that underlie an immersive sonic environment. Given the
            users' ability to adjust to diverse virtual interaction schemes
            implemented in our case studies, we hope these findings will
            encourage designers to further exploit the affordances of VR
            with regards to physics and mechanics.
            We observed a significant effect of mental models on how
            users approached each VIME. Interfaces that were viewed
            more as a game were evaluated by a different set of standards
            then those that were viewed as an instrument. We
            believe that through interaction mechanics that strike a balance
            between these two paradigms, it might be possible to
            implement VIMEs that serve more diverse creative goals.
            Given the flexibility of VR in terms of visual and mechanic
            design, it can serve as a platform not only for creative expression
            in and of itself but also for prototyping NIME ideas
            prior to physical implementation.<br>
            
            Although the relationship between games and music has
            been extensively studied [4], we believe the close collaboration
            between VR and gaming offers new opportunities for
            VIME design in terms of utilizing gamification in musical
            systems. When asked about how they viewed these VIMEs
            being used, most users referred to training, and music education
            applications. VR is indeed being increasingly used
            for educational purposes across many disciplines including
            music. We believe that VIMEs can support diverse learning
            experiences at the intersection of music education and gaming,
            alongside their more immediate applications in music
            production and audiovisual performance.
            With VR controllers, which the average user doesn't have
            extensive experiences with, we found it important to implement
            tiered control schemes that can support expressive
            behavior supplemented by more sophisticated interactions
            that enable extended functionality. <br>
                
            
            In the near future, we hope to explore the effects of VIME
            design on performance in collaborative contexts. For instance,
            constructing a musical causality system in Marbells
            with multiple users can reveal new performance dynamics
            and create opportunities for networked performances. We
            also hope to further our investigation into the perception of
            physical effort in VR since this can have signifcant implications
            for not only musical interaction design but also other
            forms of kinesiological studies in VR.
            Given the rapid growth in the consumer adoption of VR
            systems, we believe that virtual interfaces for musical expression
            will gain a prominent role in many performance
            practices in the near future.</p>
