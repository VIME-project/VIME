          <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>As virtual reality (VR) continues to gain prominence as a
            medium for artistic expression, a growing number of projects                                    explore the use of VR for musical interaction design. In
            this paper, we discuss the concept of VIMEs (Virtual Interfaces
            for Musical Expression) through four case studies
            that explore different aspects of musical interactions in virtual
            environments. We then describe a user study designed
            to evaluate these VIMEs in terms of various usability considerations,
            such as immersion, perception of control, learnability
            and physical effort. We offer the results of the study,
            articulating the relationship between the design of a VIME
            and the various performance behaviors observed among its
            users. Finally, We discuss how these results, combined with
            recent developments in VR technology, can inform the design
            of new VIMEs.</p>
