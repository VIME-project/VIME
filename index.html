          <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>As virtual reality (VR) continues to gain prominence as a
            medium for artistic expression, a growing number of projects                                    explore the use of VR for musical interaction design. In
            this paper, we discuss the concept of VIMEs (Virtual Interfaces
            for Musical Expression) through four case studies
            that explore different aspects of musical interactions in virtual
            environments. We then describe a user study designed
            to evaluate these VIMEs in terms of various usability considerations,
            such as immersion, perception of control, learnability
            and physical effort. We offer the results of the study,
            articulating the relationship between the design of a VIME
            and the various performance behaviors observed among its
            users. Finally, we discuss how these results, combined with
            recent developments in VR technology, can inform the design
            of new VIMEs.</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The multimodal and interactive experiences enabled by the
            modern VR platforms constitute a new playground for the
            digital music instrument designer. Over the past few decades,
            developments in physical computing and fabrication have
            facilitated the design of many new interfaces for musical
            expression. Today, VR is rapidly becoming a new frontier
            in this area, enabling artists and researchers to explore the
            novel affordances of immersive systems for the design of
            digital musical interfaces.
            In this paper, we discuss the concept of virtual interfaces
            for musical expression (VIMEs) in terms of the unique opportunities
            and challenges that they bring to musical interaction
            design. Building upon existing studies on virtual
            instruments, we discuss musical interaction design considerations
            in VR based on four case studies. We describe four VIMEs with details pertaining to their conceptual design, implementation and usability. We then discuss the details
            and results of a comprehensive user study that investigates
            how the different design choices in these four VIMEs affect
            the users' behaviors in VR. Finally, looking at recent
            developments in commercial technologies, we predict how
            ongoing developments in VR can contribute to the design
            of new VIMEs.</p>

            <h2>VIMEs</h2>
            <p>Digital musical instruments can sever the tie between a
            physical expression and its acoustic outcome. Although
            this may disrupt the action-perception feedback loops inherent
            to musical performance, the computational mapping
            between performance input and auditory output can lead
            to otherwise impossible associations between movement and
            sound. VIMEs extend this evolution by employing designs
            that further liberate a musical interface from physical constraints.
            Exploiting the audiovisual mechanics of an arbitrarily
            defined virtual environment, and utilizing room-scale
            embodied movement through motion tracking, VIMEs can
            enable musical interactions that traverse a line between real
            and imaginary spaces.
            NIME studies have combined software design, signal processing,
            and physical computing to conceive novel tools for
            musical creativity. If VR experiences can be characterized
            as those where the user's presence is mapped onto a
            computationally-defined space, it can be argued that many
            NIMEs already exhibit VR-like qualities through their use
            of motion tracking and spatial audio. However, many digital 
            musical instruments have also made more explicit use
            of VR. In Serafin et al.'s design principles for virtual reality
            musical instruments (VRMIs), 3 layers for the evaluation of
            such instruments are proposed: an interaction design layer
            that is concerned with the mapping between the input and
            output modalities; a VR-specific layer that is focused on the
            intrinsic qualities of a virtual experience; and a third layer
            that deals with the overall qualities and the goals of the
            interactions implemented with a VRMI [14]. These layers
            touch upon issues relating to NIME design on one end and
            the development of content for VR on the other; the area
            between these two poles can be considered as the main space
            for the development of VIMEs, which can be conceived as
            musical systems that extend beyond instruments. A VIME,
            for instance, can be formulated as a virtual sound installation
            or an interactive experience. Mirroring the broad scope
            of applications in NIME research in virtual space, a VIME
            can range from a hand-held virtual object to an infinite environment,
            the shared quality between the two being their
            facilitation of musical expression.</p>
